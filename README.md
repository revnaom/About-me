## Hey there!

### I'm Louise, but my nickname is Revna, because in Old Norse this name translates to "raven".
(Yes, I love these birds, and we are similar in many ways.)

**My credo**:
>No one can do it better than yourself.

#### Background: 
I'm a specialist in publishing by education, but my career was built exclusively on working with documents. I'm currently learning C++ and have many plans for it. 
I came into the development field because of a long-standing dream of creating a game. It is much easier to learn yourself than to look for someone who knows how to do it. My credo confirms this.
